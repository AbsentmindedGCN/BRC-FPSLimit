# FPS Limit

This is a lightweight mod that allows the user to limit their FPS from an external config file, editable through r2modman.
The plugin is handy for speedrunners as the stable FPS makes tricks more consistent and the plugin comes without any unnecessary features.

## How to Use

Install the mod via Thunderstore or r2modman itself, then boot the game once to generate the config file.
Default FPS limit is 120, but it can be changed to whatever value you wish.


## Building

Make sure you have a `BRCPath` environment variable defined on your system, which points to the root folder of your Bomb Rush Cyberfunk installation. This way the project can find the required DLLs.
